What makes the romance, based on the Nicholas Sparks novel of the same name, so compelling is that even those who are happy to see her end up with Noah can’t help but hope that Lon finds his own happily ever after.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon Prime</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Broadcast News (1987)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The blonde-haired blue-eyed Tom (William Hurt) is a <a href=#>born on-air personality</a>, while Aaron (Albert Brooks) is not quite safe (and <a href=#>far too sweaty</a>) for TV. Despite their professional differences, both men are competing for the affections of the same woman: a skilled but sometimes severe news producer, Jane (Holly Hunter). The ending of Broadcast News, which feels rather ahead of its time, shows that there are far more than two choices when it comes to both the news business and matters of the heart.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hulu</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Graduate (1967)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Graduate begins with the seduction of recent college grad Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) by Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the wife of his father’s law partner who is at least 20 years his senior. (In real life, the 35-year-old Bancroft was only six years older than her co-star.) The Mike Nichols comedy is all fun and late night liaisons, until Benjamin finds himself falling for her more age appropriate daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), much to Mrs. Robinson’s chagrin.

Amid World War II, exiled former American freedom fighter Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) has built a life for himself in the titular Moroccan city, far away from Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), the woman who abandoned him years earlier. But when she unwittingly walks into his gin joint with her husband, Czech resistance leader Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid), looking for a way to escape the Nazis, it’s clear things aren’t quite over between them. Yet Rick knows that the only way to save her is to let her go. They may not have a future together, but they’ll <a href=#>always have Paris</a>—and for him, that has to be enough.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Max</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Age of Innocence (1993)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Grab all of the tissues, you’re going to need them for the <a href=#>Martin Scorsese</a>-directed Gilded Age weepie based on Edith Wharton’s 1920 novel of the same name. In 1870s New York, Daniel Day Lewis’ chivalrous lawyer Newland Archer is set to marry a respectable woman, the sweet and virtuous May Weiland (Winona Ryder). But he soon finds himself falling in love with May’s cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), who has been ostracized by the city’s elite following her separation from her husband. Age of Innocence is a beautiful tragedy of manners that questions whether it is better to follow one’s own heart or the rules set by polite society.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Apple TV</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon Prime</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Philadelphia Story (1940)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you were <a href=#>Katharine Hepburn</a>, who would you rather marry: Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart? It’s the question at the heart of the classic romantic comedy The Philadelphia Story. Wealthy socialite Tracy Lord (Hepburn) is on the brink of walking down the aisle with fellow aristocrat George Kittredge (John Howard). Their wedding is the talk of the town, which is how her ex-husband, yacht designer-turned-journalist C.K. Dexter Haven (Grant), and his photographer Mike Connor (Stewart), end up at her home to cover the star-studded affair. It’s in the days before saying “I do” that Tracy begins to rethink the choices she’s made to please her family. In the end, Tracy leaves George at the altar for another guy who she believes will give her the life she’s always wanted.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">House of Flying Daggers (2004)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">House of Flying Daggers is an exhilarating martial arts film about love and betrayal.

With the help of fellow cop Leo (Andy Lau), Jin works to land a confession from Mei, but amid the investigation, both men find themselves falling for her. The <a href=#>Zhang Yimou</a> film ends with the three battling it out to the death in an action sequence for the ages; a poetic end to a love story destined to end tragically.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Jules and Jim (1962)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The complex love triangle at the center of <a href=#>François Truffaut</a>’s landmark French New Wave film is between two best friends, Jules (Oskar Werner) and Jim (Henri Serre), and the young woman, Catherine (Jeanne Moreau), they both love. Jules and Jim is often credited with creating the <a href=#>manic-pixie-dream-girl</a> trope before we had a term for it. But many, including movie critic <a href=#>Roger Ebert</a>, argue that the film isn’t about Jules and Jim’s quest to win the freewheeling Catherine’s heart. It’s about her long, hard journey into adulthood; a reading that makes the ending of this trilateral romance all the more bittersweet.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Max</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Half of It (2020)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Netflix’s <a href=#>The Half of It</a>, high school football star Paul Munsky (Daniel Diemer) is crushing on popular girl Aster Flores (Alexxis Lemireso) so he enlists the shy, but shrewd Ellie Chu (Leah Lewis) to write her a love letter for him. The only problem is: Ellie has a thing for Aster, too, in this <a href=#>Cyrano de Bergerac</a>-inspired teen rom-com with a queer twist that's a welcome addition to the love triangle canon.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Sabrina (1954)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Two wealthy brothers, played by Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, find themselves competing for the same girl: the titular character played by <a href=#>Audrey Hepburn</a>.

But it isn’t until after she returns from Paris—looking more sophisticated than ever—that they give her a second glance. Now, she must figure out if either one of these guys really loves her for who she is or if she’s just a trophy to be won.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Hunger Games (2012)</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">No offense to the <a href=#>Twihards</a>, but Twilight's Bella, Edward, and Jacob have nothing on Katniss and her guys, Peeta and Gale.

But their fake romance doesn’t sit well with Katniss’ District 12 bestie Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who secretly harbors feelings for her. No matter what team you’re on, The Hunger Games offers a compelling battle for Katniss’ heart and soul.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Apple TV</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Apartment (1960)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A pencil pusher at an insurance agency (Jack Lemmon) finds himself falling for his office’s sweet elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine).

Peter’s estranged family quickly adopts her and she can’t help but fall in love with them. Specifically, Peter’s brother Jack (Bill Pullman), who is at first suspicious of Lucy, but soon finds himself captivated by his brother’s soon-to-be fake wife.

The charming romantic drama based on Irish author Colm Toibin’s 2009 novel of the same name offers a thoughtful look at what it really means to put down roots with someone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Max</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hulu</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Piano (1993)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In <a href=#>Jane Campion</a>’s feminist classic <a href=#>The Piano</a>, talented pianist and mute Ada (Holly Hunter) finds herself at the center of an odd love triangle.

Both Lady Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) and her cousin, Abigail (Emma Stone) are battling for the affections of England’s Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) in hopes of earning power over her court. But as the film goes on, it’s clear that not everyone is faking their lustful feelings for the depressed ruler, which makes the <a href=#>final shot of The Favourite</a> feel even bleaker.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Apple TV</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Reality Bites (1994)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Budding filmmaker Lelaina Pierce (Winona Ryder) has a thing for her friend, former convenience store clerk and scruffy <a href=#>grammar savant</a> Troy Dyer (<a href=#>Ethan Hawke</a>).

That’s the predicament Diane Keaton’s character, playwright Erica Barry, finds herself in with <a href=#>Nancy Meyers</a>’ mature rom-com that shows you’re never too old to find love.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Your Sister’s Sister (2011)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After the death of his brother, Jack (Mark Duplass) needs a break, so his best friend Iris (Emily Blunt) sends him to her father’s cabin in the woods. It’s there he meets her sister Hannah (Rosemarie DeWitt), who has set up camp there after a breakup. The two make for easy drinking buddies and bedmates. But when Iris arrives with plans to tell Jack that she’s in love with him is when things get really complicated in Lynn Shelton’s tender drama. Like, possibly stealing someone’s sperm kind of complicated.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Bound (1996)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Three years before they created The Matrix, the Wachowskis made Bound, a lesbian heist movie in which the deadly eternal triangle at the center of it—a violent gangster (Joe Pantoliano), his conniving girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly), and an ex-con (Gina Gershon)—must work together to steal from the mafia. But can these three really be trusted? In this modern edge-of-your-seat noir, all’s fair in love and gang war.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pluto TV</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Love & Basketball (2000)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The hoopers at the center of <a href=#>Love & Basketball</a>, Quincy (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa Lathan), fall in and out of love throughout their lives. And while the climax of the sports drama has Monica balling to keep Quincy from marrying another woman, the real love triangle at the center of the movie is between those two and basketball, the shared passion that risks tearing them apart.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Apple TV</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Pretty In Pink (1986)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the John Hughes classic Pretty in Pink, Molly Ringwald plays Andie, a stylish teen from the wrong side of the tracks who falls for classmate Blaine (Andrew McCarthy), a (mostly) goodhearted yuppie who finds himself enamored with her despite the objections of his caddish best friend (<a href=#>James Spader</a>, giving a masterful performance). But Blaine’s not the only guy in love with Andie; her sweet, but awkward bestie Duckie (Jon Cryer) is too shy to tell her how he really feels. (Though <a href=#>lip synching for his life</a> to Otis Redding’s “Try a Little Tenderness” should have been a clear giveaway.) But there’s an awkward truth about this teen love triangle: Andie doesn’t seem as torn between the two as so many in the audience are. <a href=#>#JusticeForDuckie</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Past Lives (2023)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Celine Song</a>’s poignant romance Past Lives spans 24 years, two continents, and two great loves. As a tween growing up in South Korea, Nora (<a href=#>Greta Lee</a>) dreamed of marrying her best friend Hae Sung (Teo Yoo). In reality, she ends up with Arthur (John Magaro), a budding author she meets at a writing retreat in Montauk. Seven years into her marriage, Hae Sung comes to visit her in New York and she finds herself wondering what could have been.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hulu</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Blood Simple (1984)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Coen Brothers debut feature is a nasty thriller in which a husband (played by Dan Hedaya) sets out to kill his wife (Frances McDormand in her movie debut) for taking up with another man, who also happens to be his employee (John Getz). Blood Simple is a twisty noir that will keep you guessing on where each of the members of this devilish triangle’s allegiances lie until the very bloody end.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Max</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">My Best Friend’s Wedding (1997)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Jules (Julia Roberts) finds out her best friend Michael (Dermot Mulroney)—with whom she had a longstanding pact that they would get married if they were both single at 28—is engaged to a younger woman (Cameron Diaz), she sets out to win him back by any means necessary. By the end of My Best Friend’s Wedding, you may find yourself asking: is Jules part of a love triangle or just delusional?

Heck, she’s not even the worst person in this movie. Instead, she is a lost twenty something woman trying to figure out whether she wants to be with a curmudgeonly cartoonist 15 years her senior (Anders Danielsen Lie) or a laidback barista (Herbert Nordrum). Or, maybe, perhaps find a third option that will make her even happier.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hulu</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Closer (2004)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It can be hard to look away from the car crash that is Closer’s ever changing love square: Dan (Jude Law) loves Alice (Natalie Portman), but cheats on her with Anna (Julia Roberts), who is married to Larry (Clive Owen), who plans to seduce Alice out of revenge. So why then would you do it? Because there’s something heartbreakingly therapeutic about watching this foursome try to come to terms with their own infidelities in director Mike Nichols’ penultimate film.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Gone With the Wind (1939)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Frankly, you might not give a damn about Gone With the Wind, but the <a href=#>controversial Hollywood classic</a> has one of the most compelling love triangles ever put to screen. Set during the American Civil War, Southern belle Scarlett O’Hara (Vivien Leigh) spends a decade obsessing over Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), the film’s most tragic character, while spurning the advances of Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a strikingly handsome soldier who is both her knight in shining armor and her greatest antagonist. All of this makes for a tormented love story with an ending that is still as explosive as it was 90 years ago.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stream it on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Max</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWdmg3OCjqWmr51dqb%2Bqrc2go55lnaTDqrHSZpqhmZyhsq%2BzxKuqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flove-triangle-movies-challengers.html&text=The%20Best%20Love%20Triangle%20Movies&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flove-triangle-movies-challengers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flove-triangle-movies-challengers.html&title=The%20Best%20Love%20Triangle%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flove-triangle-movies-challengers.html&title=The%20Best%20Love%20Triangle%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flove-triangle-movies-challengers.html&title=The%20Best%20Love%20Triangle%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flove-triangle-movies-challengers.html&description=The%20Best%20Love%20Triangle%20Movies" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./agt-act-mervant-vera-combines-magic-and-rap-in-early-release-audition.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'AGT' Act Mervant Vera Combines Magic and Rap in Early Release Audition">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1369191-robie-uniacke-bio-who-rosamund-pikes-long-term-partner-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robie Uniacke's bio: Who is Rosamund Pikes long-term partner?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
