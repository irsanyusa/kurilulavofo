While there are some questions surrounding the customer experience, the company is known for its affordable prices and offers good value for basic insurance coverage.</p><h2 id=times-take>TIME’s Take</h2><p>Liberty Mutual is a well-known insurance brand, particularly for <a rel=alternate href=#>auto insurance</a>. Its affordable coverage includes bundling and other discounts, though other types of insurance, such as <a rel=alternate href=#>renters insurance</a>, aren’t priced as competitively. If you’re considering Liberty Mutual, check to make sure it's active in your area, as its services aren’t available in all U.S. states.</p><p>Go to:</p><p><a rel=alternate href=#>Liberty Mutual car insurance</a><br><a rel=alternate href=#>Liberty Mutual homeowners insurance</a><br><a rel=alternate href=#>Liberty Mutual life insurance</a><br><a rel=alternate href=#>Liberty Mutual renter’s insurance</a><br><a rel=alternate href=#>Liberty Mutual pet insurance</a></p><h2 id=liberty-mutual-car-insurance>Liberty Mutual car insurance</h2><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Liberty Mutual’s car insurance products</a> are among its most popular—so much so that car insurance is the first option you’ll see when you begin the quote process on the company’s website.</p><h3 class=product-title>Liberty Mutual Auto Insurance</h3><p>Monthly premium</p><p>$90</p><p>AM Rating</p><p>A</p><p>JD Power Customer Satisfaction</p><p>870 (11)</p><p>NAIC Complaint Index</p><p>2.46</p><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Liberty Mutual’s auto insurance</a> stands out for its affordable price and plentiful features, but the company’s high <a rel=nofollow href=#>National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index</a> and low <a rel=nofollow href=#>Better Business Bureau (BBB) rating</a> indicate potential customer service issues. (See our full Liberty Mutual auto insurance review (<a rel=alternate href=#>here</a>.)</p><h3>Pros and cons</h3><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Affordable pricing.</li><li>Includes popular features such as Usage Based Insurance (UBI), a deductible fund, and gap insurance (which can be harder to find among auto insurers).</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Higher-than-average complaint index per the NAIC.</li></ul><h3>Cost</h3><p>If you’re looking to save money on auto insurance, insuring your vehicle with <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Liberty Mutual</a> may work in your favor.</p><p>According to U.S. News & World Report, the <a rel=nofollow href=#>annual average cost of car insurance is $1,547</a>—higher than the estimated $1,092 per year a 45-year-old would spend on <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Liberty Mutual car insurance</a>.</p><p>(Note: That figure increases to $1,656 per year if that 45-year-old has a speeding ticket, and car insurance costs are always highly individualized based on your driving habits and history, vehicle type, age, location, and many other factors.)</p><h3>Top features</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Liberty Mutual</a> like many other auto insurers these days, offers a usage-based insurance (UBI) program. It’s called <a rel=nofollow href=#>RightTrack</a>, which, the company says, could save you up to 30% on your auto policy as a whole. (You earn a 10% discount immediately upon enrollment.)</p><p>The company also offers a <a rel=nofollow href=#>deductible fund</a>—otherwise known as a vanishing deductible or disappearing deductible—which can lower the amount you’d pay toward your deductible in the event of a loss. Each year, you can pay $30 toward this fund, and <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Liberty Mutual</a> will contribute $70 for up to five years, translating to $500 in potential deductible savings.</p><p>Additionally, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Liberty Mutual</a> offers gap insurance, which covers the amount you owe on your loan above the vehicle’s value in the event it’s stolen or totaled. Not every auto insurer offers gap insurance (Geico, for instance, does not), so if you need it, it’s a nice product to be able to bundle.</p><h3>Where it falls short</h3><p>Unfortunately, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Liberty Mutual</a> has garnered more than its fair share of complaints per the NAIC, with a complaint index of 3.12 at the time of writing. (The national average is 1.0, and Geico’s complaint index is 1.88.)</p><h3>How it stacks up</h3><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 iYXWdO not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 oGfrp"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 kklmFK" readability=31><tr class=table-row readability=3><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4.5><p>Annual price (45 year-old, no ticket)</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=9><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Additional Features</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5.5><p>Gap insurance, UBI, deductible fund, bundle discounts</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>UBI, bundle discounts</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5><p>Loan/lease payoff coverage up to 25% of vehicle value, UBI, bundle discounts</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>NAIC Complaint Index</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=liberty-mutual-homeowners-insurance>Liberty Mutual homeowners insurance</h2><p>Homeowners insurance helps protect the four walls you call home—and <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Liberty Mutual</a> offers this type of coverage.

And, depending on the state where you live and other factors, you may be able to score discounts with Liberty Mutual for having a new roof, signing up for paperless billing, buying your policy online, and more.</p><h3>Where it falls short</h3><p>Once again, the main thing holding Liberty Mutual back is its lackluster customer service reputation, as evidenced by its higher-than-average NAIC complaint index and lower-than-average BBB customer review rating (1.09 out of 5 stars at the time of writing).</p><h3>How it stacks up</h3><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 iYXWdO not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 oGfrp"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 kklmFK" readability=32.5><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Available Discounts</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Above-average</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=15><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Additional Available Coverage</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5.5><p>Flood insurance, personal property replacement, jewelry, electronics</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4.5><p>Personal property replacement, keepsakes</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5.5><p>Flood insurance, personal property, special computer coverage, water backup/sump overflow</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>NAIC Complaint Index</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=liberty-mutual-life-insurance>Liberty Mutual life insurance</h2><p>While you can’t buy life insurance from Liberty Mutual directly, the company has partnered with TruStage to offer term, whole, and guaranteed acceptance whole life insurance to Liberty Mutual customers. The policy comes with a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, so you can cancel for any reason, within the first month of taking out your policy.</p><h3>Pros and cons</h3><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>No-medical-exam life insurance coverage available.</li><li>Term and whole life insurance options available.</li><li>30-day satisfaction guarantee.</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Death benefit limited to $300,000 for term and $100,000 for whole life policies.</li><li>Death benefit limited during first two years of guaranteed acceptance whole life insurance policy.</li><li>Policy is not offered directly through Liberty Mutual.</li></ul><h3>Cost</h3><p>When TIME pulled a sample quote for a 34-year-old female, premiums hovered at $55 per month for a $250,000 term life insurance policy. According to data gathered by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Progressive</a>, these quotes are substantially higher than the national average; per their research, a $250,000 term life insurance plan might cost $15.01 per month for a 30-year-old female or $17.84 for a 40-year-old one. (Men's premiums are higher across the board.)</p><p>However, like all types of insurance coverage, life insurance premiums are calculated with a variety of factors in mind, including the health history of the applicant along with their age and sex. Additionally, Liberty Mutual’s life insurance products don’t require a physical exam, which may partially explain the elevated quote.</p><h3>Top features</h3><p>Guaranteed acceptance whole life insurance is ideal for those with complicated health histories or facing a tricky diagnosis. According to Liberty Mutual’s frequently asked questions, “If you’re between ages 45 and 80, you’re eligible, and you can keep it for life. You cannot be turned down, even if you have cancer or other health problems.”</p><p>In fact, all of Liberty Mutual’s life insurance policies are available without a medical exam—though the company doesn’t guarantee acceptance under its term life insurance coverage.</p><h3>Where it falls short</h3><p>Death benefit caps of $300,000 for term life insurance coverage and $100,000 for whole life insurance fall well below the needs of many people who may want a higher death benefit to help achieve larger financial goals, such as paying off a house or helping dependents pay for college.</p><h3>How it stacks up</h3><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 iYXWdO not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 oGfrp"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 kklmFK" readability=26><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Coverage Caps</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>$300k term; $100k whole</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Up to $2 million</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Up to $8 million</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=2><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>No-Exam Coverage Available?</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Maximum Age</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=liberty-mutual-renters-insurance>Liberty Mutual renter’s insurance</h2><p>Those who rent rather than own their homes can benefit from renter’s insurance, which covers your personal belongings in the event of a qualified loss, or offsets legal fees if someone is injured in your home.

According to data from <a rel=nofollow href=#>USA TODAY Blueprint</a>, the average cost in Oregon for such a plan is $12 per month, so Liberty Mutual came in a bit high.</p><h3>Top features</h3><p>Unlike many other renter’s insurance policies, Liberty Mutual does have the option to add earthquake insurance coverage—a must-have for those who rent in earthquake-prone areas.

According to publicly available data about other pet insurers, Liberty Mutual’s rates are competitive, though perhaps not the cheapest.</p><p>With that said, pet owners can choose from several coverage tiers to ensure they don’t pay for services they don’t think they’ll need.</p><h3>Top features</h3><p>Liberty Mutual’s pet insurance allows you to work with any vet you choose—although this is because they run on a reimbursement model rather than direct billing, meaning upfront costs for pet owners.</p><p>Tiers start at accident-only coverage, which reimburses policyholders for expensive emergency procedures and treatments, including anesthesia due to an accident or treatment for ingesting a foreign object. The accident-and-illness tier adds coverage for illnesses including cancer and kennel cough, and the accident, illness, and wellness tier includes preventive wellness exams, flea and tick medication, prescription medications, and more.</p><h3>Where it falls short</h3><p>For pet owners who wish to avoid pricey vet bills altogether, Liberty Mutual may not be the answer. Although up to 90% of your costs will be reimbursed, you’ll still be out of pocket in the intermittent period. (However, these sorts of policies can be hard to find—and a reimbursement model gives pet owners the flexibility to choose whichever vet they like.)</p><h3>How it stacks up</h3><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 iYXWdO not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 oGfrp"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 kklmFK" readability=39.5><tr class=table-row readability=22><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Coverage Options</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5.5><p>Accident, accident & illness, and accident, illness & wellness tiers</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=8.5><p>Base plan with diagnostics, procedures, and medications included; vet visit fee coverage, preventative care coverage, dental illness coverage, behavioral conditions, physical therapy, and end-of-life care available as add-ons</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=6><p>Basic coverage including diagnostics, accidents, and illnesses; standard wellness, Metlife’s preventative-inclusive coverage</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=7><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Additional Features</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Bundling and other stackable discounts</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4.5><p>Puppy- and kitten-specific plans, bundling discounts</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Telehealth services available 24/7</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Pays Vets Directly</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=liberty-mutual-customer-service>Liberty Mutual customer service</h2><p>As mentioned multiple times above, Liberty Mutual has a concerningly high NAIC complaint index of more than 3.0—much higher than the average of 1.0. (Amica, by comparison, <a rel=nofollow href=#>has an index of just 0.8</a>, which is favorable.)</p><p>However, per a <a rel=nofollow href=#>2023 J.D. Power study</a>, Liberty Mutual ranked second among auto insurers in “providing a satisfying purchase experience,” coming in second only to State Farm.</p><h2 id=liberty-mutual-costs>Liberty Mutual costs</h2><p>While specific premiums and deductibles are always the result of complex algorithms insurance companies use to assess a policyholder’s risk level, Liberty Insurance’s products stack up well, price-wise, according to publicly available national averages. While less expensive insurance products may be available, it’s hard to beat Liberty Mutual for its available discounts, and since it offers so many different types of insurance, bundling is easy.</p><h2 id=methodology>Methodology</h2><p>We assessed Liberty Mutual’s various insurance products using publicly available data online to compare important customer considerations like cost, available discounts, additional features, and customer service reputation. Sources include WalletHub, U.S. News & World Report, NerdWallet, Policygenius, the NAIC, and J.D. Power, among others.</p><h2 id=bottom-line>Bottom line</h2><p>Given its more than 100-year history and vast array of insurance products, Liberty Mutual is a solid choice for anyone looking for a one-stop-shop for their insurance coverage needs—especially given the potential for bundling discounts.</p><p>Even standalone Liberty Mutual coverage products often include discount eligibility for certain customers. The company also stands out for its vast array of add-ons and features (among them, gap coverage for auto insurance customers and flood insurance for those buying homeowners insurance).</p><p>You can certainly find less expensive insurance products, and Liberty Mutual’s customer service reputation leaves something to be desired. But overall, Liberty Mutual is an insurer worth considering.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Is Liberty Mutual an A-rated insurance company?</h3><p>Yes. As per insurance credit rating agency <a rel=nofollow href=#>AM Best</a>, Liberty Mutual holds an A rating, which is an indicator of the company’s financial strength and ability to pay out claims. Liberty Mutual also maintains a rating of A- with the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Better Business Bureau (BBB)</a>, though its customer reviews on the site are considerably lower than average.</p><h3>Is Liberty Mutual better than Geico?</h3><p>While it’s impossible to issue a blanket response to such a question, both Liberty Mutual and Geico have their pros and cons, depending on the types of coverage you’re shopping for. Liberty Mutual, for instance, ranked more highly in J.D. Power’s 2023 survey of auto insurance customer satisfaction than Geico did, but Geico’s auto insurance prices tend, on average, to be lower than Liberty Mutual’s.</p><h3>Why is Liberty Mutual so cheap?</h3><p>As a well-established company with over 100 years in business and a wide variety of available financial products, Liberty Mutual can offer its customers lower prices because of economies of scale. In addition, Liberty Mutual often offers discounts based on factors that reduce the risk of loss, such as your home having a new roof (homeowners insurance), or you having a safer driving record (auto insurance).</p><h3>Is Liberty Mutual an honest company?</h3><p>Liberty Mutual maintains an A rating, according to AM Best, a credit rating agency specifically geared toward insurance companies, and an A-rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB). However, it has a higher-than-average complaint ratio with the NAIC, and its publicly available customer service reviews tend to be quite low.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmapnaKovK%2Bty2adoqaRo7Cme8Crq6KbnJp8rbXBnqmtsV2iwrXBwKVkoqajqr%2BiusKeZKudpp6yuHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fliberty-mutual-insurance-review.html&text=Liberty%20Mutual%20Insurance%20Review%202024&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fliberty-mutual-insurance-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fliberty-mutual-insurance-review.html&title=Liberty%20Mutual%20Insurance%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fliberty-mutual-insurance-review.html&title=Liberty%20Mutual%20Insurance%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fliberty-mutual-insurance-review.html&title=Liberty%20Mutual%20Insurance%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fliberty-mutual-insurance-review.html&description=Liberty%20Mutual%20Insurance%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tv-guides-first-issue.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TV Guide's First Issue (Famous Photo)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./le-hclpd-demande-larret-des-delegations-du-contingent-de-logements-de-letat-aux-communes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Le HCLPD demande l'arrt des dlgations du contingent de logements de l'Etat aux communes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
