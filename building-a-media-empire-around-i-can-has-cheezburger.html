For the uninitiated, that’s his wildly popular website to which users submit photos and videos documenting such colossally stupid moves as writing a billboard partly in Braille and using a trash can as a bike helmet. Like the rest of the 20-odd websites Huh owns, FAIL Blog was added to his empire for no more specific reason, he says, than “Dude, I think it’s funny.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>(See the 25 best blogs of 2009.)</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These spellbindingly inane blogs were built with the kind of user-generated content that has made Facebook and YouTube tremendously popular. But unlike these bigger sites, Huh’s company has been in the black since its first quarter. Pet Holdings managed to haul in seven figures from advertising, licensing fees and merchandise sales during the first six months of this year, according to a report given to Huh’s investors. His advertising model is low rent; 30% of ads go for premium prices of up to $8 per 1,000 page views. The rest can sell for as little as 15Â¢ — but legions of devoted followers pull in the necessary volume. In July, Huh’s sites attracted a total of 10.4 million unique visitors, many of whom logged on multiple times a day. His online success has even landed him speaking engagements in the venerable newsrooms of the <i>Guardian</i> and the New York <i>Times</i>. “There’s no way on the planet this should actually work,” Huh says of his business plan. “But it’s working.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What’s working, exactly, is a series of viral humor sites intended simply “to make people happy for five minutes a day,” as Huh puts it. Huh, 31, a journalist turned dotcom entrepreneur, was born in South Korea and moved to California when he was in his teens. He launched Pet Holdings in 2007 when angel investors helped him buy a new website called I Can Has Cheezburger?, which is a compendium of “Lolcats,” laugh-out-loud feline photos captioned in “kitty pidgin,” or artfully misspelled imaginings of cats’ inner monologues. (The original Lolcat features a fat gray fur ball gazing longingly past the camera under the heading I CAN HAS CHEEZBURGER?) Huh discovered the site, which was started by two Hawaiian bloggers, when they linked to a photo on his personal blog. His site quickly buckled under the traffic, and he e-mailed to complain — then figured there was money to be made in such a zealous online community.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>(See the 50 best websites of 2008.)</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His other offerings now include Probably Bad News, which catalogs news bloopers, like the headline CHILDREN COOK & SERVE GRANDPARENTS. GraphJam invites users to create statistical commentaries on pop culture, like a pie chart estimating the proportion of e-mails that come from “Friends,” “MySpace” or, the largest category, “People Who Want Me to Have a Bigger Penis.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Speaking to the <i>Times</i> this year — and echoing what he told the <i>Guardian</i> staff and some 1,000 techies at the 2008 Future of Web Apps Expo in London — Huh said the key to making a site take off is connecting it to a cultural phenomenon. I Can Has Cheezburger?, for instance, pokes fun at an oft-maligned, inscrutable household pet, appealing to cat lovers and others. (Huh is allergic.) FAIL Blog has helped popularize <i>fail</i> as both a noun and an exclamation, not to mention an easier-to-spell synonym for <i>schadenfreude</i>. Another site, This is Photobomb, gives a name to otherwise perfectly good photos spoiled by an interloper — think streakers in the background of a wedding shot. “Everybody has seen it. Nobody knew what to call it,” says Huh.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>See the best social networking applications.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>See the top iPhone applications.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The moment you see something like a Photobomb happen, we want you to think of our site,” he says. And people do: only a quarter of his users find their way to Huh’s blogs through miscellaneous links or social-networking sites such as StumbleUpon and Facebook. The other 75% head directly to his sites, either typing in the URLs or searching for them via Google.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">More than anything else, Huh seems to have a knack for nailing the zeitgeist. Any of his sites, after all, could easily have become yet another passing online craze. (Remember the Numa Numa Guy?) Pet Holdings’ page views, however, are growing at an annual clip of 300%. Huh admits some sites fall flat: “There’s stuff you will never even hear about because it sucks so bad.” For example, My Wedding is a Big Deal!, an assortment of bridal <i>fails</i>, Photobombs and other snafus, didn’t quite gel. Another contender, called That’s So Racist — for posting public examples of unintentional racism — was deemed a nonstarter. “We decided to pass on it because the comments would probably just descend into trolling and negativity,” Huh says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>(Read “Creating a Cute Cat Frenzy.”)</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But on the whole, Pet Holdings shows no sign of losing steam. Just the opposite, in fact: the sites are making inroads off-line. A Cheezburger-inspired book spent 13 weeks on the New York <i>Times</i> paperback best-seller list last winter, and three follow-up titles are on their way this fall. FAIL Blog ink stampers and Lolcats magnetic poetry sell like hotcakes. Contributors to the LOLCat Bible Translation Project, which launched in 2007, are almost through translating the entire Good Book into kitty pidgin. (It opens, “Oh hai. In teh beginnin Ceiling Cat maded teh skiez An da Urfs.”) <i>I Can Has Cheezburger: The MusicLOL!</i> is scheduled to debut Aug. 14 at the New York International Fringe Festival. The show follows several cats and a “Lolrus” in search of a particular food. “It’s a classic quest arc,” says co-writer Kristyn Pomranz. “We really wanted to explore this holy grail that is a cheeseburger.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So what’s the secret of Huh’s success? Part of the charm of his sites is that they appear to be put together by rank amateurs. “It’s on purpose,” says Huh. Actually, they’re carefully cultivated by 20 staffers, mostly Seattle-based, including a lapsed lawyer and a former investment banker. The company is hiring roughly one staffer a month and gets some 100 applications for every position. Applicants should not offend easily and must have held a job they hated, says Huh, to better appreciate the joys of spending their days perusing funny photos. Plus, he says, “we want them to have spent serious time goofing off on the Internet.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The staffers who sift through the 10,000 photos and videos that users submit each day never write their own jokes or even edit users’ captions; they simply cull the best offerings. If something is funny but is a questionable fit for an existing site, they’ll start a new one. FAIL Blog, for instance, spawned There, I Fixed It, a catalog of such misguided repair jobs as an airplane apparently patched together with duct tape. They’re always searching for new memes — jokes or fads that could slip into the virtual jet stream and spread.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Huh, who works in a windowless 8-by-8-ft. server closet, like a Web Wizard of Oz (“It gets really hot with the door shut, so meetings have to be short,” he says), admits he knows what he’s looking for only when he sees it. “You can’t really explain why it’s funny,” he says. “That’s part of the fun.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>See TIME’s Pictures of the Week.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>See the Cartoons of the Week.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tcXFhboVwrtSio52hnpx6onnMnpuimV2aurG10Z5kmqqfqrulechmmpqmXZ2utHnCoZyespKqv6ix0Wg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbuilding-a-media-empire-around-i-can-has-cheezburger.html&text=Building%20a%20Media%20Empire%20Around%20I%20Can%20Has%20Cheezburger&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbuilding-a-media-empire-around-i-can-has-cheezburger.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbuilding-a-media-empire-around-i-can-has-cheezburger.html&title=Building%20a%20Media%20Empire%20Around%20I%20Can%20Has%20Cheezburger" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbuilding-a-media-empire-around-i-can-has-cheezburger.html&title=Building%20a%20Media%20Empire%20Around%20I%20Can%20Has%20Cheezburger" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbuilding-a-media-empire-around-i-can-has-cheezburger.html&title=Building%20a%20Media%20Empire%20Around%20I%20Can%20Has%20Cheezburger" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbuilding-a-media-empire-around-i-can-has-cheezburger.html&description=Building%20a%20Media%20Empire%20Around%20I%20Can%20Has%20Cheezburger" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-nathalie-emmanuel-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Nathalie Emmanuel Make?
