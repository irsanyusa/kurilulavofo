Many of&nbsp;today’s celebs we&nbsp;know and love had to&nbsp;endure years and years of&nbsp;<a href=# title=poverty data-link=tag>poverty</a> and hardship before becoming the world’s sweethearts. Their stories inspire&nbsp;us and make&nbsp;us believe that dreams can indeed come true with a&nbsp;little <a href=# title=perseverance data-link=tag>perseverance</a> and hard work.</p><p>That’s why we&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>have decided to&nbsp;share these inspiring stories with all of&nbsp;you. Perhaps they’ll help boost your confidence and get you to&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;yourself!</p><p><h2>Hilary Swank</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de7/733/f736825f678f8b178a32826994.jpg><p>Before becoming the star of&nbsp;the film, Million Dollar Baby, this 2-time Oscar-winning actress had to&nbsp;endure the hardships of&nbsp;poverty. Swank’s father left her mom very early on&nbsp;with three kids to&nbsp;take care&nbsp;of. When her mother got laid off, they decided to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;leap of&nbsp;faith and move to&nbsp;California. There, they were forced to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;car, and work many odd jobs for survival till they could afford an&nbsp;apartment. Today, Swank has a&nbsp;net worth of&nbsp;$40&nbsp;million.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2011 interview with Daily Mail, Swank said, “Growing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lower-income family, you don’t have the resources to&nbsp;make ends meet and you have to&nbsp;find creative ways to&nbsp;get&nbsp;by.” She added, “That infuses your character with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;drive and determination.” Swank is&nbsp;really an&nbsp;inspiration.</p><p><h2>Sarah Jessica Parker</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7cb/998/e48be959f8927ba88ba546f1c6.jpg><p>Long before she gained stardom on&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series, Sex and the City, <a href=# title="Sarah Jessica Parker" data-link=tag>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> and her family were living on&nbsp;welfare. Parker speaks openly about living life on&nbsp;welfare and the daily humiliation attached to&nbsp;it. Sarah told The Times, “I&nbsp;remember being poor. There was no&nbsp;great way to&nbsp;hide&nbsp;it. We&nbsp;didn’t have electricity sometimes. We&nbsp;didn’t have Christmases sometimes, or&nbsp;we&nbsp;didn’t have birthdays sometimes, or&nbsp;the bill collectors came or&nbsp;the phone company would call and say, ’We’re shutting your phones off.’” Yet, Parker managed to&nbsp;escape her past and now has an&nbsp;astounding net worth of&nbsp;$90&nbsp;million.</p><p><h2>Demi Moore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9b9/18b/c66a1458cc86257c5ca2ec7e5f.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>’s most loved hottie, <a href=# title="Demi Moore" data-link=tag>Demi Moore</a> did not have a&nbsp;very glorious childhood. She had to&nbsp;endure living with an&nbsp;alcoholic mother and stepfather. Moore left her high school during her junior year and when she was 16&nbsp;she decided to&nbsp;rise above all the negativity and pursue a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;modeling. Later, she took drama classes and rest is&nbsp;history. Moore’s hard work paid off and her current net worth is&nbsp;estimated at&nbsp;$150&nbsp;million.</p><p><h2>Jim Carrey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b2/6a3/cb0cfa5730a6f1574c3372d77b.jpg><p>Funniest man alive, <a href=# title="Jim Carrey" data-link=tag>Jim Carrey</a> did not have much to&nbsp;laugh about in&nbsp;the past. The Canadian born actor’s life was going fine until his dad lost his job. When Carrey’s family lost their home they were forced to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;van. The actor even worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;security guard and janitor to&nbsp;help support his family. But knowing he&nbsp;was destined to&nbsp;do&nbsp;bigger things, Carrey managed to&nbsp;land major comedy hits such as&nbsp;The Mask, Cable Guy, and Dumb and Dumber. His present net worth is&nbsp;now at&nbsp;$150&nbsp;million.</p><p><h2>Leonardo DiCaprio</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/683/909/3514fa573ab1ee7a0b6f3cdc18.jpg><p><a href=# title="Leonardo DiCaprio" data-link=tag>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> says it&nbsp;all in&nbsp;Titanic, “I&nbsp;am the king of&nbsp;the world!”&nbsp;— and he&nbsp;literally has become the king of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;people’s hearts. But most people don’t know that DiCaprio lived out some of&nbsp;his movie characters’ scenarios in&nbsp;real life, like going from rags to&nbsp;riches in&nbsp;Titanic all the way to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;financial master like he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;The Wolf of&nbsp;Wall Street.</p><p>The actor used to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;seedy&nbsp;LA neighborhood where he&nbsp;saw drugs, poverty, prostitution, and violence at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very tender age. He&nbsp;told The Times, “It&nbsp;goes back to&nbsp;that neighborhood. It&nbsp;came from the fact that&nbsp;I grew up&nbsp;very poor, and&nbsp;I got to&nbsp;see the other side of&nbsp;the spectrum.” Now DiCaprio’s net worth is&nbsp;estimated at&nbsp;$245&nbsp;million.</p><p><h2>Tom Cruise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb0/52d/20a8ff5b7d8455457f2bc9aabf.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;very rare that <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a>’s movies don’t do&nbsp;incredibly well in&nbsp;the box office. The actor’s exceptional acting abilities have made him worthy of&nbsp;a&nbsp;$470 million dollar net worth.</p><p>Although he&nbsp;was lucky enough to&nbsp;enjoy some success at&nbsp;an&nbsp;early age, Cruise actually grew up&nbsp;poor. His parents got divorced when he&nbsp;was 11&nbsp;and his mother had to&nbsp;work four jobs just to&nbsp;pay the bills. When was 16&nbsp;and had participated in&nbsp;the school’s production of&nbsp;the musical Guys and Dolls, his unbelievable career was born.</p><p><h2>J.K. Rowling</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf5/07a/fcd98c50418f11cff768697abf.jpg><p>Nobody can understand how life can change overnight quite like J.K Rowling can. Long before her success as&nbsp;a&nbsp;writer, she had to&nbsp;endure severe poverty. Being a&nbsp;single mother, living on&nbsp;welfare, battling depression, and writing the manuscript of&nbsp;Harry Potter with her baby by&nbsp;her side in&nbsp;different cafes, Rowling was at&nbsp;the lowest point of&nbsp;her life.</p><p>Rowling hit the Jackpot with her Harry Potter book series after years of&nbsp;being told that she would not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;make any money with children’s books. Thanks to&nbsp;the books and the movie franchise, Rowling has a&nbsp;net worth of&nbsp;an&nbsp;unbelievable $1&nbsp;billion dollars. Also, in&nbsp;2017, the author earned the title of&nbsp;World’s Highest Paid Author and was the third highest paid celebrity across all categories in&nbsp;the entire world.</p><p><h2>Oprah Winfrey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e8/b6c/3da9e65cecaf1a4c1dc6fc3001.jpg><p><a href=# title=Oprah data-link=tag>Oprah</a> is&nbsp;the epitome of&nbsp;hard work and good attitude paying off. It’s no&nbsp;wonder she tops this list. Oprah’s life has always been an&nbsp;open book&nbsp;— Oprah has admitted to&nbsp;being born into a&nbsp;poor family by&nbsp;an&nbsp;unwed teenage mom. She lived with her grandmother until she was six years old before living with her mom. Not only did Oprah endure living on&nbsp;welfare, she even suffered from physical and sexual abuse. But Oprah decided to&nbsp;rise above it&nbsp;all and started working at&nbsp;a&nbsp;local radio station after high school. Needless to&nbsp;say, she never looked back. Today, Oprah owns NOW, a&nbsp;<a href=# title=media data-link=tag>media</a> empire and has a&nbsp;net worth is&nbsp;$2.8&nbsp;billion.</p><p><h2>Chris Pratt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f77/646/5b2acb5e6e84e1682825765518.jpg><p><a href=# title="Chris Pratt" data-link=tag>Chris Pratt</a> has had quite a&nbsp;journey from being homeless to&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;bonafide A-list star. After dropping out of&nbsp;college, Pratt moved to&nbsp;Hawaii where he&nbsp;lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;van. While remembering his days sleeping in&nbsp;vans and tents on&nbsp;the beach, Pratt told an&nbsp;interviewer with The Independent , “It’s a&nbsp;pretty awesome place to&nbsp;be&nbsp;homeless.” Thankfully, actor-director, Rae Dawn Chong who offered Pratt his first role in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie where he&nbsp;played a&nbsp;waiter at&nbsp;the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in&nbsp;Maui. His net worth now is&nbsp;$21&nbsp;million.</p><p>These celebrities and their stories prove that nothing is&nbsp;impossible even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;feels like the entire universe is&nbsp;up&nbsp;against you. Do&nbsp;you know anyone who has had all their dreams come true? Make sure to&nbsp;let&nbsp;us know in&nbsp;the comments&nbsp;— those people deserve to&nbsp;recognized!</p><p>Diving deeper into Tom Cruise’s persona, his uniqueness sets him apart in&nbsp;Hollywood. From garnering numerous accolades, including three Golden Globes, to&nbsp;performing his own stunts, Cruise’s <a href=#>dedication to&nbsp;his craft</a> is&nbsp;unparalleled. His financial acumen is&nbsp;evident in&nbsp;his record-breaking film grosses, and his compassion shines through in&nbsp;his off-screen actions, such as&nbsp;aiding accident victims. Interestingly, Cruise once aspired to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;priest and has a&nbsp;peculiar pattern with numbers in&nbsp;his relationships. His adventurous spirit is&nbsp;not confined to&nbsp;the screen, as&nbsp;he’s an&nbsp;avid scuba diver, pilot, and skydiver. His relationships often intertwine with his professional life, leading to&nbsp;collaborations with co-stars and ex-partners.</p><p>The bond between <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and Kate Winslet was further solidified during their “Titanic” days when DiCaprio made a&nbsp;transformative comment about Winslet’s body. This remark, emphasizing the importance of&nbsp;her natural shape, empowered Winslet to&nbsp;champion body positivity, reshaping her perspective on&nbsp;beauty standards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZur8SlnJuqmanGbr7AoKpmrJ9iv6qvx56qZqukpL%2BqsdJmq6GZpGK0qsLEZqysZZGhuW60zqmcZmxmZYF3fI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f9-celebrity-rags-to-riches-stories-that-give-us-all-hope-460460.html&text=9Celebrity%20Rags-to-Riches%20Stories%20That%20Give%20UsAll%20Hope&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f9-celebrity-rags-to-riches-stories-that-give-us-all-hope-460460.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f9-celebrity-rags-to-riches-stories-that-give-us-all-hope-460460.html&title=9Celebrity%20Rags-to-Riches%20Stories%20That%20Give%20UsAll%20Hope" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f9-celebrity-rags-to-riches-stories-that-give-us-all-hope-460460.html&title=9Celebrity%20Rags-to-Riches%20Stories%20That%20Give%20UsAll%20Hope" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f9-celebrity-rags-to-riches-stories-that-give-us-all-hope-460460.html&title=9Celebrity%20Rags-to-Riches%20Stories%20That%20Give%20UsAll%20Hope" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f9-celebrity-rags-to-riches-stories-that-give-us-all-hope-460460.html&description=9Celebrity%20Rags-to-Riches%20Stories%20That%20Give%20UsAll%20Hope" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./abbreviations-in-spanish.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Abbreviations in Spanish and how to use them">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./6-effective-ways-to-make-your-neck-look-younger-448760.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="6 Effective Ways to Make Your Neck Look Younger">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
