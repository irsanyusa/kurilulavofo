This kit has made cleaning my&nbsp;dryer vent a&nbsp;breeze. The lint brush vacuum hose attachment effectively removes stubborn lint and debris, ensuring my&nbsp;dryer runs efficiently and reduces the risk of&nbsp;fire hazards.</i><br><i>The power washer feature is&nbsp;a&nbsp;game-changer, blasting away lint buildup in&nbsp;no&nbsp;time. The included dryer vent vacuum hose is&nbsp;a&nbsp;convenient addition, reaching even the tightest spaces. Overall, it’s a&nbsp;must-have tool for anyone looking to&nbsp;maintain their dryer and improve its longevity.

Use it&nbsp;religiously for 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;days and all of&nbsp;that dead <a href=# title=skin data-link=tag>skin</a> just sloughs off naturally. Speaking of&nbsp;natural, it’s an&nbsp;all natural formula. Truth be&nbsp;told, my&nbsp;dog doesn’t love the process, but&nbsp;I usually give him a&nbsp;little treat after&nbsp;I apply this, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;goes&nbsp;ok.</i><br><i>Besides that this stuff really works! I&nbsp;have the larger tin and the small tube. The advantage of&nbsp;the smaller tube is&nbsp;it&nbsp;functions as&nbsp;an&nbsp;applicator too. A&nbsp;little easier than dabbing some on&nbsp;your finger.

They left it&nbsp;around, I&nbsp;cleaned it&nbsp;up. But now&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;cat that leaves thick, thick black hair and undercoat everywhere. I’ve tried every possible method of&nbsp;cleaning&nbsp;it, and&nbsp;I finally resigned myself to&nbsp;covering “his” chair with a&nbsp;sheet that&nbsp;I would just throw out and replace often. I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;notice about this pet hair roller with other Prime Day products and decided to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;try.

It&nbsp;was like sandstone! My&nbsp;skin nice and soft now but during it&nbsp;was red and angry looking! Face my&nbsp;face was shiny and felt tight! I&nbsp;accidentally went hard on&nbsp;my&nbsp;lips but a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;dead lip skin came off.</i><br><i>Anyway, I’m about 15&nbsp;minutes post-shower and the results are INCREDIBLE!

They can accommodate small or&nbsp;large cup sizes and can be&nbsp;worn even with see-through clothing.

They did not disappoint! I&nbsp;wore them for a&nbsp;night of&nbsp;dancing in&nbsp;the club and also to&nbsp;an&nbsp;11am college football game.

I&nbsp;wash them with Dr&nbsp;Bronner’s <a href=# title=soap data-link=tag>soap</a> and water, let dry, and then put the plastic back on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;them for storage. They are super sticky again after being washed.

It&nbsp;works wonders on&nbsp;all breeds of&nbsp;dogs and cats, small or&nbsp;big, and is&nbsp;gentle on&nbsp;their skin. It&nbsp;doesn’t include any harsh detergents and the LP3 enzyme system helps to&nbsp;maintain fresh smelling ears.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e7b/396/4bd8835b9c854a786ee401a6f6.jpg><p>You can use this solution to&nbsp;clean your pet’s dirty ears and even after an&nbsp;infection. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;perfectly safe for flushing. Simply fill the ear canal with our ear solution and massage it&nbsp;into the base of&nbsp;the ear canal. Then use some cotton balls or&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean cloth to&nbsp;gently remove any debris that comes to&nbsp;the surface.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>This stuff worked quickly.

You just add shampoo on&nbsp;your baby’s head and use the sponge to&nbsp;brush&nbsp;it. You then use the gentle brush to&nbsp;massage the baby’s head and loosen up&nbsp;the flakes.

It&nbsp;started just between the 2-3 month age. I&nbsp;began googling what cradle cap&nbsp;is, what causes&nbsp;it, all the things. Some say leave it&nbsp;alone, some say you can treat&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;wasn’t sure what to&nbsp;do. To&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;seemed like it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;itchy or&nbsp;just uncomfortable on&nbsp;the head, so&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;look for a&nbsp;treatment solution.</i><br><i>Naturally I&nbsp;gravitated towards Frida baby because&nbsp;I have the other kits for my&nbsp;baby and love their products. But once&nbsp;I read the reviews and saw photos here on&nbsp;Amazon I&nbsp;bought it&nbsp;and was like yes let’s treat&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;bought this as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the other two products that go&nbsp;with&nbsp;it (the soap and spray). If&nbsp;you are like&nbsp;me, researching figuring out what you should do...buy this.</i><br><i>Buy the other two products, follow the steps, and you will immediately see results. Immediately. After my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I used it&nbsp;on&nbsp;our baby, all of&nbsp;it&nbsp;was gone. My&nbsp;Baby’s head is&nbsp;so&nbsp;soft. His hair looks shiny and clean and the skin looks newborn fresh. I&nbsp;don’t know why&nbsp;I even considered leaving the cradle cap on&nbsp;his head...so glad&nbsp;I got this product and so&nbsp;happy with how beautiful my&nbsp;baby’s head and hair look.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@aenkhggzhzdcth</a></li></ul><h2>10. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>A&nbsp;retinol serum</a> made to&nbsp;treat post acne marks and the damaged skin texture. It&nbsp;works on&nbsp;all skin types, and it&nbsp;helps the skin recapture its lost shine by&nbsp;minimizing the pores. You just apply a&nbsp;thin layer of&nbsp;the serum and let it&nbsp;get absorbed. Then you can add any other products you want.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/73f/49f/4d90b35ff6a933b4b1b462cb8b.jpg><p>You can apply this serum both at&nbsp;day and at&nbsp;night.
