One woman said Adams sent her inappropriate sexual messages while she was underage. This Is Us star Mandy Moore, who was married to Adams from 2009 to 2016, said the singer was emotionally abusive during their relationship and stifled her own musical ambitions. Singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers said Adams became obsessive and controlling during a brief relationship. Once she broke up with Adams, Bridgers said, he rescinded offers to help further her musical career.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a statement to the Times, a lawyer for Adams “unequivocally denie[d] that he ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage.” In a series of tweets published on Feb. 13, Adams further denied the claims in the article, while apologizing to anyone he had hurt, “however unintentionally.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes.

In an interview with the Washington Post published on Sept. 16, <a href=# rel=noopener>Blasey Ford said</a> that an intoxicated Kavanaugh pinned her down on a bed and groped her during a party. She said Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. She said she was able to escape when another man at the party jumped on top of both Kavanaugh and Blasey Ford.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a statement on Friday sent by the White House to the Post, Kavanaugh said: “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.” The White House issued another statement on Monday denying the allegation. “On Friday, Judge Kavanaugh ‘categorically and unequivocally’ denied this allegation,” a <a href=# rel=noopener>White House spokesperson said</a>, according to the Post. “This has not changed. Judge Kavanaugh and the White House both stand by that statement.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a second statement released by the White House on Monday, Kavanaugh said: “This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. I am wiling to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refuse this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Blasey Ford initially contacted the Post in July through a tip line, and sent a letter to Democrat Anna Eshoo, her congresswoman, in July. In August, she decided not to come forward, fearing it would negatively affect her life, according to the Post. She changed her mind after <a href=# rel=noopener>The New Yorker reported</a> that a <a href=#>woman sent a letter</a> to Democrats in Congress detailing the alleged incident.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">140.

Fager’s departure comes just days after CBS CEO Les Moonves left the company amid allegations of sexual harassment. In <a href=# rel=noopener>The New Yorker‘s Sept. 9 story about Moonves</a>, six women said that Fager had touched employees at company parties and protected male subordinates accused of sexual harassment. Sarah Johansen told the magazine that Fager groped her at a work party when she was an intern at CBS in the 2000s.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">CBS News President David Rhodes said in a statement, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to CNN</a>, that the “action today is not directly related to the allegations surfaced in press reports, which continue to be investigated independently. However, he violated company policy and it is our commitment to uphold those policies at every level.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a statement to CNN, Fager said: “The company’s decision had nothing to do with the false allegations printed in The New Yorker. Instead, they terminated my contract early because I sent a text message to one of our own CBS reporters demanding that she be fair in covering the story. My language was harsh and, despite the fact that journalists receive harsh demands for fairness all the time, CBS did not like it. One such note should not result in termination after 36 years but it did.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to <a href=# rel=noopener>a report from CBS News</a>, Fager texted CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan: “If you repeat these false allegations without any of your own reporting to back them up you will be held responsible for harming me. Be careful. There are people who lost their jobs trying to harm me and if you pass on these damaging claims without your own reporting to back them up that will become a serious problem.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A spokesperson for CBS did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">139.

The woman filed a criminal complaint Monday, which alleges Depardieu sexually assaulted her on August 7 and August 13 in his home in Paris, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to French newspaper Le Parisien.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Depardieu’s attorney, Herve Temime, said on France’s BFM TV that Depardieu “absolutely denies any rape, any sexual assault, any crime.” Temime did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">138.

The Times story was based on documents the paper received anonymously.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bennett <a href=#>issued his first public statement</a> through his attorney on Aug. 22, which said: “I did not initially speak out about my story because I chose to handle in private with the person who had wronged me. My trauma resurfaced as she came out as a victim herself. I have not made a public statement in the past days and hours because I was ashamed and afraid to be part of the public narrative.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a statement released on Aug. 21, Argento <a href=#>called the allegation</a> “absolutely false” and denied ever having a sexual relationship with Bennett. She said her late partner Anthony Bourdain recommended paying Bennett to avoid “possible negative publicity that such a person, whom he considered dangerous, could have brought upon us.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said it was aware of the alleged incident, and a spokesperson for the department <a href=#>told TIME</a> that it is attempting to reach out to Bennett and his representatives “in an effort to appropriately document any potential criminal allegations.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Aug. 27, Variety <a href=# rel=noopener>reported that Argento had been fired</a> as a judge from Italy’s X Factor. Argento has not yet commented, and her agent did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Sept. 5, Argento’s new attorney, Mark Heller, <a href=# rel=noopener>released a statement</a> that said: “As revealed in the text messages published by TMZ, Asia stated, ‘The horny kid jumped me … I had sex with him it felt weird.’ She went on to relate that she became ‘frozen’ when he was on top of her and told her that she had been his sexual fantasy since he was 12 years old. Asia chose at the time not to prosecute Bennett for sexually attacking her.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The statement also said that Bourdain only paid Bennett $250,000 of the $380,000 settlement, and Argento will not be making any more payments to Bennett.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bennett’s attorney did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment on Heller’s statement.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">137.

Six women told Farrow that Moonves had behaved inappropriately toward them between the 1980s and late 2000s, including four who alleged that he touched them inappropriately and two who accused him of physical intimidation and threatening behavior.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Throughout my time at CBS, we have promoted a culture of respect and opportunity for all employees, and have consistently found success elevating women to top executive positions across our Company,” Moonves said in a statement to TIME. “I recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected – and abided by the principle – that ‘no’ means ‘no,’ and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone’s career.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The New Yorker report also contradicts the first part of Moonves’ statement, suggesting that harassment may have occurred across the organization. Several employees, for example, accused former chairman of CBS News and a current executive producer of 60 Minutes Jeff Fager of inappropriately touching or flirting with colleagues, and of turning a blind eye toward other misconduct, according to the story.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Sept. 9, <a href=# rel=noopener>The New Yorker reported</a> six other women <a href=#>accused Moonves of sexual assault or harassment.</a> including allegations that he forced two women to perform oral sex on him.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a statement to The New Yorker, Moonves said: “The appalling accusations in this article are untrue. What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS. And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women. In my 40 years of work, I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations. I can only surmise they are surfacing now for the first time, decades later, as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name, my reputation, and my career. Anyone who knows me knows that the person described in this article is not me.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Moonves <a href=#>resigned from CBS</a> hours after the second The New Yorker report was published. In a statement, the network said it would donate $20 million — deducted from severance benefits owed to Moonves — to organizations that support the #MeToo movement. The network’s chief operating officer Joseph Ianniello will serve as CEO and president until a permanent replacement is named.
