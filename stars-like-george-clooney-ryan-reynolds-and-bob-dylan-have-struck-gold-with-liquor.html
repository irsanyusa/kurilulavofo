You're just trying to figure out how I can sell this product that tastes pretty damn similar to Bulleit Rye."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In an email to Business Insider, MGP confirmed that brands large or small could bottle and brand its bourbons, whiskeys, gins, or vodkas without modification. However, it stipulated that most clients do make some kind of alterations, with or without MGP's assistance.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-158d636c-8ba4-4303-b105-a384bcb13f53 data-caption="Bob Dylan Heaven's Door whiskey"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/eUxktktTURBXy8yYjlkYmY0MS0zY2QwLTRiN2QtYmU1Yi0zZmEwNjRjYjY5NzYucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>While Dylan's Heaven's Door doesn't make its own distillate, Bushala said that the brand takes a very different approach than just rebottling sourced product.</p><p>"We're not really tied to a single producer," he explained, adding that the company finish the product themselves their rye release, for instance, was aged in French cigar barrels, which is where much of the character comes from.</p><p>Whatever they're doing seems to be working, as, though sales figures are not yet publically available, the whiskey has been widely lauded by critics. Drinks expert <a href=# id=2282a800-eb83-33ee-a89b-b4dfe8b1af7a>Dave Wondrich</a> called the 10-year-old expression "a wonderfully balanced bourbon, rich and chewy and dangerously drinkable."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=# id=edd92801-921d-32d2-a646-6d9b1f24b6ab>The Whiskey Wash</a> scored the bourbon 4/5, noting its "hints of cherry and sourdough," "aroma of warm baked bread," and " a wonderfully thick mouthfeel" "the flavors keep coming and coming."</p><p>Heaven's Door has now started laying down barrels of its own in pretty significant quantities, and is in the process of building a distillery in Nashville though this will be used for blending and finishing, rather than for the entire output.</p><p>At the end of the day, though, chances are most people but celebrity booze brands don't care that much about the liquid's origins as long as it tastes good.</p><p>"I think a lot of the celebrity alcohol brands are preying on the fact that average consumers don't spend 12 hours a day reading about production practices," Goldfarb says.</p><p>"So when they hear Bob Dylan has a whiskey, they'll take that at face value."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-105>Its getting to the point where you cant even parody it</h3></p><p>According to Goldfarb, the celebrity drinks trend is not slowing down.</p><p>"It feels like it's almost getting to the point where you can't even parody it almost every single day it seems like a new celebrity is announcing a product," he says.</p><p>However, while the current proliferation of celebrity spirit brands might be sustainable, it's not going to get any bigger, according to Malandrakis.</p><p>"I think that it will continue, I don't think it will accelerate," he says. "There's a constant within this industry, and it will be more about pairing the right brand with the right celebrity and how that can be improved."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Bushala agreed, adding: "I think it's going to continue because it can be a very successful formula. It'll come back down to the quality of the product.</p><p>"If you're a huge Justin Bieber fan and he releases a tequila, you're probably going to buy it, but if it's crap then you won't buy it again."</p><p>If you're a huge Justin Bieber fan and he releases a tequila, you're probably going to buy it, but if it's crap then you won't buy it again.</p><p>By this logic, bad products die off while the best survive. And this is largely true, as we've seen.</p><p>As craft beers and spirits continue to grow in popularity, celebrities are experimenting more with higher quality products, which is great for the consumer. However, even if they buy from bulk producers, it gives those distilleries more revenue and freedom to experiment with better liquids which is also great for the consumer.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Even Goldfarb concedes that the celebrity-backed booze brand might be a good thing for the industry on the whole.</p><p>"The trend does seem to be towards better product at least, now they're selling aged spirits," he said.</p><p>"No connoisseur likes these celebrity products, but if it's getting people that have never really tried tequila or whiskey into them then I guess it's not the worst thing in the world."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=deae40e6-ee36-3cad-ad2f-c7b58efaa6de>Here's why you should never put vodka in the freezer, according to the creator of Grey Goose</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7xaKlmqaTmny0wMCrqmakmaCybrPEqKmgnV2YubC7zZ6wZqqplrtuvsSypaiklKh6orrDZpmoml2Zxq2tzWafmq6VYsC1vtScomafn6GxbsPIrZ9mpJmmwrC%2Bjq2jm2qbaIE%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstars-like-george-clooney-ryan-reynolds-and-bob-dylan-have-struck-gold-with-liquor.html&text=Stars%20like%20George%20Clooney%2c%20Ryan%20Reynolds%2c%20and%20Bob%20Dylan%20have%20struck%20gold%20with%20liquor%20launches%2c%20and%20c&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstars-like-george-clooney-ryan-reynolds-and-bob-dylan-have-struck-gold-with-liquor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstars-like-george-clooney-ryan-reynolds-and-bob-dylan-have-struck-gold-with-liquor.html&title=Stars%20like%20George%20Clooney%2c%20Ryan%20Reynolds%2c%20and%20Bob%20Dylan%20have%20struck%20gold%20with%20liquor%20launches%2c%20and%20c" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstars-like-george-clooney-ryan-reynolds-and-bob-dylan-have-struck-gold-with-liquor.html&title=Stars%20like%20George%20Clooney%2c%20Ryan%20Reynolds%2c%20and%20Bob%20Dylan%20have%20struck%20gold%20with%20liquor%20launches%2c%20and%20c" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstars-like-george-clooney-ryan-reynolds-and-bob-dylan-have-struck-gold-with-liquor.html&title=Stars%20like%20George%20Clooney%2c%20Ryan%20Reynolds%2c%20and%20Bob%20Dylan%20have%20struck%20gold%20with%20liquor%20launches%2c%20and%20c" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstars-like-george-clooney-ryan-reynolds-and-bob-dylan-have-struck-gold-with-liquor.html&description=Stars%20like%20George%20Clooney%2c%20Ryan%20Reynolds%2c%20and%20Bob%20Dylan%20have%20struck%20gold%20with%20liquor%20launches%2c%20and%20c" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./national-library-wales.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The National Library of Wales">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1360555-omah-lay-biography-lyrics-who-coming-musician-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Omah Lay biography, lyrics: Who is this up and coming musician?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
