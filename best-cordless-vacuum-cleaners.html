Consistent vacuuming keeps your home free of dust, hair, and other little pieces of detritus so you can keep things clean and literally breathe easier. If you’re prone to dust allergies or have pets, then a regular vacuuming habit is especially crucial. Fortunately, the concept of a vacuum is pretty simple: point the machine in the right direction and let the suction do its job. Unfortunately, vacuuming often means awkwardly maneuvering a bulky machine around your home, while constantly plugging and unplugging the power cord. I know I’ve been tempted to give up half-way through after getting the cord stuck on a piece of furniture for the fifth time.</p><p>Enter: the cordless vacuum. They’re designed to be charged and used freely, so you don’t need to worry about tripping over the cord. The best versions are also built to be lightweight and portable, to take better advantage of their cordless design. This often means they have a stick vacuum shape, which helps them fit into small areas and take up minimal storage space—a huge plus in my book. Additional functions might include attachments for pet hair or small crevices, extra power settings for different surfaces, and HEPA filtration. While not the most exciting purchase, a cordless vacuum cleaner can make a world of difference to your cleaning schedule.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-cordless-vacuum-cleaners>Our top picks for the best cordless vacuum cleaners</h2><h3>Best budget cordless vacuum: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Black+Decker POWERSERIES Extreme MAX Cordless Stick Vacuum</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Black+Decker POWERSERIES Extreme MAX Cordless Stick Vacuum</h3></p><p>It can be difficult to find a good vacuum cleaner for under $200, which is why I was so delighted by the Black+Decker POWERSERIES Extreme MAX. It offers many of the same features of more high-end products, including extra attachments for pet hair and crevices, and can be converted into a handheld device for hard to reach areas.</p><p>The battery life isn’t quite as long as other vacuums I looked at, lasting just 37 minutes when used as a stick vacuum, but this may not be a problem for smaller homes or day-to-day cleaning. The PowerSeries Extreme Max also doesn’t feature a HEPA filter, but it does have cyclonic filtration which helps to keep the filter clean and requires less manual maintenance. Overall, this is a great affordable option if you don’t want to invest in a pricier model. It may not be quite as powerful as more expensive items on my list, but it’s still quite effective on the usual household debris.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Battery life/runtime: 37 minutes (stick), 56 minutes (hand)</li><li>Weight: 10.8 pounds</li><li>Bin capacity: N/A</li><li>Anti-allergy filter (HEPA): No</li><li>Vacuum type: Stick vacuum, handheld functionality</li><li>Wet compatible: No</li><li>Price on publish: $149.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>One of the most affordable yet effective models out there</li><li>Features LED headlights that are ideal for spotting hidden debris, especially under furniture</li><li>Anti-tangle beater bar prevents hair from getting wrapped</li><li>Multiple extra accessories and a handheld option for greater versatility</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Run time is not as long as other devices on my list</li><li>No HEPA filter</li></ul><h3>Best cordless stick vacuum: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum</h3></p><p>As much as I may want the most technically advanced, flashy vacuum, sometimes it’s the mid-range product that offers the best performance for the best price. With the Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum, you get the advanced auto-detection technology of more expensive vacuums—in this case, Shark’s Clean Sense IQ system—for the more reasonable price of $499.99.</p><p>You also get HEPA filtration, the ability to trap 99.97% of allergens, and 60 minutes of runtime, although the charging time is noticeably long so you’ll want to make sure you’ve charged it up in advance. Shark has developed its own odor neutralization technology and included it in this model, so you’ll get a fresh laundry scent that releases as you clean. Finally, I appreciate that the stick vacuum has a hinged body, so that you can more easily reach under furniture without needing to bend over. While this isn’t the most exciting or lightweight model, the Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum works hard, for a fair price.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Battery life/runtime: 60 minutes</li><li>Weight: 8.9 pounds</li><li>Bin capacity: 0.18 gallons</li><li>Anti-allergy filter (HEPA): Yes</li><li>Vacuum type: Cordless stick vacuum</li><li>Wet compatible: No</li><li>Price on publish: $499.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Clean Sense IQ system detects debris levels and adjusts suction power accordingly</li><li>Odor neutralizer technology that releases a fresh laundry scent as you clean</li><li>Long run time of 60 minutes, ideal for larger spaces</li><li>Hinged wand so that it can bend and reach under furniture with ease</li><li>More affordable price than other cordless vacuums with auto-detection and HEPA filtration</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Bulkier than some other models and nearly nine pounds in weight</li><li>Not quite as effective on plush carpet</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>For a mid-level price, you can get high-level performance from the Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum, which offers auto-detection, odor neutralization, and a hinged wand for better reach.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow>Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum</a></p><h3>Best cordless vacuum for carpet: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Tineco Pure One S11</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Tineco Pure One S11</h3></p><p>While vacuums are most commonly used on carpet, that doesn’t mean that every vacuum cleaner does a good job. Despite its great price of just under $300, the Tineco Pure One S11 is a great all-rounder that performs well on both low-pile and mid-pile carpet. Its built-in iLoop Smart Sensor connects to an LED display that lights up red when there is debris or dust detected, then shifts to blue when this has been suctioned away, so you can be confident that you’ve cleared away any mess.</p><p>I appreciate that it includes HEPA filtration, which is often only available in more expensive products, and that it claims an allergen-removal rate of 99.97%. It’s also nicely lightweight, although the handheld version is a bit bulky to use and the bin capacity is lower than many other vacuums we looked at; you’ll need to empty it more often. Overall, this is a high-quality performer that you can trust to keep your carpeted floors pristine.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Battery life/runtime: 40 minutes</li><li>Weight: 5.73 pounds</li><li>Bin capacity: 0.16 gallons</li><li>Anti-allergy filter (HEPA): Yes</li><li>Vacuum type: Stick vacuum, handheld functionality</li><li>Wet compatible: No</li><li>Price on publish: $299.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Nice price of just under $300, even with its advanced technology</li><li>Ultra-quiet motor creates minimal disturbance while vacuuming</li><li>The iLoop Smart Sensor technology detects changes in debris and adjusts suction automatically</li><li>HEPA filter and an allergen-removal rate of 99.97%, for greater peace of mind</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Handheld detachment is a bit bulky and awkward to use</li><li>Not quite as effective on hard floors</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>The Tineco Pure One S11 is a solid all-rounder that particularly shines on carpeted floors, with an LED display that clearly shows when debris is both detected and removed.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tineco Pure One S11</a></p><h3>Best cordless vacuum for pet hair: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Innova by Eureka Cordless Stick Vacuum</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Innova by Eureka Cordless Stick Vacuum</h3></p><p>y thing is that this hair—just like human hair—can easily get tangled around the vacuum’s roll bar, which reduces effectiveness and requires regular manual removal. This is why I love the Innova by Eureka Cordless Stick Vacuum, which makes fast work of pet hair and transfers it to the dustbin with minimal issue. Even on soft furnishings and furniture, the vacuum is able to pick up pet hair and remain tangle-free.</p><p>This lightweight vacuum has a decent amount of dustbin capacity and a battery runtime of 60 minutes, making it ideal for larger homes with furry residents. While it can be quite loud during use, with several customers noting the higher volume, its efficiency means you won’t need to use it for long. I also appreciate that it includes HEPA filtration, so you can feel confident that any animal or dust allergens have been safely contained. A bonus: This vacuum is available for under $230.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Battery life/runtime: 60 minutes</li><li>Weight: 9.1 pounds</li><li>Bin capacity: 0.26 gallons</li><li>Anti-allergy filter (HEPA): Yes</li><li>Vacuum type: Cordless stick vacuum, handheld functionality</li><li>Wet compatible: No</li><li>Price on publish: $229.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Anti-tangle brush roll makes it easy to pick up and trap pet hair on any kind of surface</li><li>HEPA filtration and a dual-action roll bar ensures particles stay trapped</li><li>Long battery life of 60 minutes and a low weight for easy maneuvering around the house</li><li>Affordable price</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Louder than most other products on the list</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>If you have pets at home, the Innova by Eureka Cordless Stick Vacuum is my go-to pick for removing pet hair from all kinds of surfaces, in a quick and efficient fashion.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow>Innova by Eureka Cordless Stick Vacuum</a></p><h3>Best cordless vacuum for large spaces: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Dyson V11 Outsize Plus</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Dyson V11 Outsize Plus</h3></p><p>The larger your home, the more surface you’ll need to vacuum—and the longer you’ll spend maneuvering your device and emptying its dustbin. With the Dyson V11 Outsize Plus, even larger spaces can be cleaned quickly and efficiently, thanks to its updated design: The bin capacity is 150% greater than the standard V11, while the cleaning head is 25% larger. This means less frequent emptying of the bin and quicker navigation of your home. The Outsize Plus also supports 60 minutes of runtime and deploys the same innovations as Dyson’s other high-end models, such as the signature Hyperdymium motor and radial root cyclone technology.</p><p>The only real downside is that a larger device means a heavier weight, with this vacuum weighing 17.5 pounds. However, it does convert to a handheld device for trickier-to-reach areas and it’s also more affordable than many other Dyson models; you can frequently find it on sale for under $500.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Battery life/runtime: 60 minutes</li><li>Weight: 17.5 pounds</li><li>Bin capacity: 0.5 gallons</li><li>Anti-allergy filter (HEPA): No</li><li>Vacuum type: Stick vacuum, handheld functionality</li><li>Wet compatible: No</li><li>Price on publish: $449.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>150% more bin capacity and a 25% wider cleaning head makes it easier to vacuum larger spaces</li><li>Up to 60 minutes of run time, so it can handle larger homes</li><li>One of Dyson’s more affordable models, often on sale for under $500</li><li>Utilizes the same tech of Dyson’s other high-end models, for superior suction and dust trapping</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Heaviest cordless vacuum on this list</li><li>Doesn’t stand upright; requires a wall docking stand</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>The Dyson V11 Outsize Plus is specifically designed for larger-format cleaning, with 150% more bin capacity and a 25% wider cleaning head, so you can clean big spaces in record time.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dyson V11 Outsize Plus</a></p><h3>Best cordless vacuum for furniture and appliance cleaning: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Performance Hand Vacuum Kit</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Performance Hand Vacuum Kit</h3></p><p>While vacuums are mostly used on flooring, dust can get anywhere, so it’s not uncommon for me to find myself trying to vacuum my furniture and appliances. While traditional stick vacuums often come with a handheld detachment, why compromise when you can get a dedicated handheld appliance that’s designed for these different surfaces? The RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Hand Vacuum is the handheld version of their beloved stick vacuum and offers a powerful motor with twice the suction power, in a lightweight 2.3-pound package.</p><p>Specifically designed to be used in harder-to-access spaces, this cordless hand vacuum comes with a crevice tool attachment and a dust brush for delicate surfaces. I find that this vacuum is very easy to maneuver on both hard and soft furnishings, with an easy-to-empty dustbin that never slows me down. The smaller size means that the battery only accommodates a 15-minute runtime, but this same battery is used across RYOBI appliances so if you have more than one product, you can swap out the batteries as needed across your devices.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Battery life/runtime: 15 minutes</li><li>Weight: 2.3 pounds</li><li>Bin capacity: Not listed</li><li>Anti-allergy filter (HEPA): No</li><li>Vacuum type: Handheld cordless vacuum</li><li>Wet compatible: No</li><li>Price on publish: $89</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Very lightweight at just 2.3 pounds, so you can easily navigate around different appliances</li><li>Multiple attachments, such as a crevice tool and a dust brush for delicate surfaces</li><li>Powerful motor has twice the suction power of other RYOBI vacuums, even in this small format</li><li>Easy-to-empty dustbin, so cleaning on the go is seamless</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>More expensive than some other handheld vacuums</li><li>Battery life only runs to 15 minutes at a time; not designed for large-format use</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>The RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Performance Hand Vacuum is a lightweight model that’s easy to maneuver around furniture and appliances, with a crevice tool and dust brush for different surfaces.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow>RYOBI ONE+ 18V Cordless Performance Hand Vacuum Kit</a></p><h3>Best cordless vacuum and mop combo: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Tineco Floor One S7 Pro</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Tineco Floor One S7 Pro</h3></p><p>Cleaning can be a multi-step process, involving both mopping liquids and vacuuming away dust and debris. But it doesn’t have to be—not with the Tineco Floor One S7 Pro. This vacuum includes a water tank and a water flow system that allows you to mop the floors with a fresh supply of water as you suction away dirt, streamlining your entire cleaning journey. The SmoothPower self-propulsion system lets you glide forward and backward with ease, distributing clean water as you go. The roller brush then rubs away any lingering stains, while the vacuum system pulls away debris.</p><p>Yes, the vacuum is heavier than others on the list: The 11.02-pound weight accommodates a water tank, as well as a dustbin. However, I love how this model simplifies cleaning. Even the docking system is designed to deep-clean the brush and water tube before drying the roller thoroughly, so you won’t spend ages on vacuum maintenance.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Battery life/runtime: 40 minutes</li><li>Weight: 11.02 pounds</li><li>Bin capacity: 0.19 gallons</li><li>Anti-allergy filter (HEPA): No</li><li>Vacuum type: Cordless stick vacuum</li><li>Wet compatible: Yes</li><li>Price on publish: $799.00</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Combines fresh water and suction to both mop and vacuum away debris</li><li>SmoothPower self-propulsion system easily detects forward and backward motion</li><li>LCD screen supports four different cleaning modes for different messes</li><li>Water flow system ensures only fresh water cleans, while dirty water is captured</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Heavier than most other vacuums on this list at over 10 pounds</li><li>Lower dustbin capacity than some other models; some storage space is used for clean water</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>The Tineco Floor One S7 Pro lets you ditch the mop and replace it with a dual-function vacuum that cleans away mess and suctions up debris, all in one easy motion.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tineco Floor One S7 Pro</a></p><h3>Best cordless car vacuum: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Bissell AeroSlim</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Bissell AeroSlim</h3></p><p>It’s not just our homes that get a little dusty. Cars need maintenance too, but even the slimmest stick vacuums won’t be practical in your vehicle. Instead, consider the Bissell AeroSlim. This handheld vacuum weighs just 1.37 pounds and is long and narrow in design, making it the ideal product to throw in your car for on-demand cleaning.</p><p>While it only has 12 minutes of battery life, this should be more than sufficient for day-to-day vacuuming and its USB charging system means you can plug it directly into the car’s USB port (or into a laptop, wall outlet, or other port). It’s also nicely priced at just over $40, but still offers a consistently strong performance. While the standard suction works perfectly well, I particularly like the two-in-one crevice tool and dusting brush that’s able to get into your car’s nooks and crannies, without taking up too much space. This is one of the <a href=# rel=alternate>best car vacuums</a> if you’re looking for a small footprint yet an effective performance.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Battery life/runtime: 12 minutes</li><li>Weight: 1.37 pounds</li><li>Bin capacity: 0.03 gallons</li><li>Anti-allergy filter (HEPA): No</li><li>Vacuum type: Handheld cordless vacuum</li><li>Wet compatible: No</li><li>Price on publish: $41.19</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Supremely lightweight and slim in design, so you can keep it in your car</li><li>Comes with useful attachments that can reach into your car’s nooks and crannies</li><li>Charges via USB, so you can charge directly from your car, laptop, or a wall outlet</li><li>Very affordable at just over $40; the cheapest product on this list</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Only 12 minutes of runtime, so this is not for larger cleaning projects</li><li>Small bin capacity of 0.03 gallons</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>For on-the-go cleaning and car maintenance, the Bissell AeroSlim Vacuum is a lightweight, discreet model that charges via USB for quick, efficient dust removal.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bissell AeroSlim</a></p><h3>Best cordless upright vacuum: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>RYOBI ONE+ HP 18V Brushless Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Bar</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>RYOBI ONE+ HP 18V Brushless Cordless Pet Stick Vac Kit with Dual-Roller Bar</h3></p><p>One of the few negatives of a cordless vacuum is that their slim design often requires a docking station or wall mount in order to stand upright—but not the RYOBI ONE+ HP Cordless Pet Stick Vacuum. This device is able to stand upright on its own, making it easy to leave in place during a cleaning session and then store when not in use.</p><p>The RYOBI ONE+ is also 30% lighter and 50% quieter than the brand’s previous vacuum models, so you can confidently maneuver it around your home with minimal disruption. I like the inclusion of LED lights on the roller bar, so you can easily spot debris and dust as you go, and the dual-roller design that works particularly well on pet hair. You can also remove the hair easily post-use, thanks to the detachable design of the rollers. This is one of the more affordable vacuums on this list at under $300, but you do get a shorter runtime of only 35 minutes if you use the regular battery, instead of the high performance one.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Battery life/runtime: 60 minutes</li><li>Weight: 8 pounds</li><li>Bin capacity: 0.2 gallons</li><li>Anti-allergy filter (HEPA): No</li><li>Vacuum type: Free-standing stick vacuum, handheld functionality</li><li>Wet compatible: No</li><li>Price on publish: $299</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>30% lighter and 50% quieter than RYOBI’s previous products</li><li>LED lights on the roller bar help to illuminate dust and debris on surfaces</li><li>Detachable, dual-roller design is notably effective on pet hair, able to trap 99.9% of allergens</li><li>Nicely priced at just under $300</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Regular battery only offers 35 minutes of run time, if high performance battery is out of stock</li></ul><h3>Best bagged cordless vacuum: <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Tacony Titan T500</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Tacony Titan T500</h3></p><p>Most cordless vacuums are stick, bagless designs to keep them lightweight. The downside is you have less dustbin capacity, which is what makes the Tacony Titan T500 a great combination option. This model is able to stand upright like a traditional upright vacuum, with a bin capacity of 0.7 gallons, but also has the maneuverability and lower weight of a cordless vacuum. At 11 pounds, it’s not quite as light as other options on this list, but you do get 50 to 60 minutes of runtime and HEPA filtration for added allergen protection.</p><p>Bagged models are convenient in many ways because they keep the dust secure inside; you just need to swap out the bag when it’s full, rather than empty out the dust from a fixed container. I recommend setting a reminder to buy additional dust bags so you don’t find yourself completely out, but otherwise this is a great way to minimize mess.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Battery life/runtime: 50 to 60 minutes</li><li>Weight: 11 pounds</li><li>Bin capacity: 0.7 gallons</li><li>Anti-allergy filter (HEPA): Yes</li><li>Vacuum type: Bagged cordless vacuum</li><li>Wet compatible: No</li><li>Price on publish: $599.00</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Large bin capacity, thanks to the bagged design</li><li>HEPA filtration and a self-sealing bag to protect you and your home from allergens</li><li>Nearly an hour of run-time and a quick 1 hour charging time</li><li>Able to stand upright on its own, whether mid-vacuum or for storage</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>A bit heavier than the other cordless models on this list, at over 10 pounds</li><li>Requires the purchase of additional dust bags</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>If you prefer the convenience of a sealed dust bag but want the lightweight maneuverability of a cordless vacuum, consider the Tacony Titan T500 as a perfect blend of the two.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tacony Titan T500</a></p><h2 id=how-i-selected-the-best-cordless-vacuum-cleaners>How I selected the best cordless vacuum cleaners</h2><p>When assessing products for this list, a few key considerations helped me determine which items should be included. While every home is different and people have different cleaning habits and preferences, I’ve found that every quality vacuum meets the following criteria.</p><h3>Suction performance</h3><p>Ultimately, a vacuum cleaner needs to be able to clean. This means that the device needs to be able to apply enough suction to the area that even sticky debris is picked up and removed. I looked for vacuums that offered powerful motors and high wattage suction, such as the Dyson Hyperdymium motor or Samsung HexaJet 2.0 motor. I also considered how these motors would work on different surfaces, as plush carpet requires greater suction to remove debris than a hardwood floor.</p><h3>Accessories</h3><p>The sticker price of a cordless vacuum cleaner is not just for the vacuum itself; you also get various accessories, including attachments, and often a docking station or wall mount. When assessing the value of a vacuum, it was important for me to consider how many additional features you receive with your purchase and how effective these are. If the built-in roller bar doesn’t support vacuuming on hardwood floors, but there’s an optional attachment just for this use, then I considered that a well-rounded vacuum. I also looked for extra features like crevice tools, handheld functionality, and auto-emptying docking stations for added convenience.</p><h3>Weight and dustbin size</h3><p>Most people turn to a cordless vacuum because of their lightweight design, but this weight can still vary substantially across models. Since cordless models do feature less power than corded ones because of the battery, it was important that they delivered on maneuverability, and so I assessed each model on its stick vacuum weight.</p><p>However, I also balanced this against dustbin capacity. For some people, lower capacity might be a worthy price to pay for a truly lightweight model, while others may prefer a heavier weight in exchange for less frequent bin emptying. With that in mind, I considered the relationship between overall weight and dustbin capacity, to measure whether the balance was a suitable trade-off.</p><h3>Surface versatility</h3><p>Dust can collect on any surface, so it’s important to have a vacuum that can handle the different materials in your home. I looked for vacuums that could handle a range of surfaces, either through a single brush bar or through additional attachments. While some vacuums come with a built-in sensor that can adjust the suction performance accordingly, others require you to switch out the brush head for optimum efficiency; I approved both, as long as they worked well. If a vacuum was advertised as working particularly well on one specific surface, I still made sure to assess whether that vacuum would also perform well elsewhere in the home.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-a-cordless-vacuum-cleaner>What to consider when buying a cordless vacuum cleaner</h2><h3>Battery life and runtime</h3><p>Cordless vacuums don’t plug into an electric power socket during use, so they need to run on battery power. These batteries will support runtime for a limited period before they need to be charged again, with the battery life varying among brands and models. Depending on how large your home is, you may want to look for a vacuum with an extended battery life so you can clean the entire home on one charge. Alternatively, if you live in a small space then battery life may not be the most important factor. Instead, you may want to look for vacuum cleaners with quick charging times, in case you want to vacuum spontaneously but forgot to charge it ahead of time.</p><h3>Size, weight, and capacity</h3><p>Different vacuum cleaners come in different sizes and weights, with some focusing on portability and others focusing on capacity. Slimmer designers are likely to have smaller dust compartments and will therefore need more frequent emptying in between vacuuming sessions. Larger devices will be able to fit much more dust at a time, but may be a bit bulkier or heavier to use. Depending on your preferences, one design will likely be more practical for you. Of course, there are some mid-range options that are a balance of each of these factors, if you’re looking for a blend of the two.</p><h3>Price point</h3><p>Cordless vacuums use advanced technology and you pay for this innovation. Even the most affordable options on my list cost a couple hundred dollars, but you can spend several times that for the most high-end options on the market. The good news is that these purchases should last you several years, even with frequent use, and so the upfront investment may prove great value over time. When making your decision, it’s useful to consider how often you’ll be using the machine; for larger households and pet-friendly homes, a good vacuum cleaner may be a more impactful purchase.</p><h2 id=how-to-use-a-cordless-vacuum-cleaner>How to use a cordless vacuum cleaner</h2><p>Vacuum cleaners are pretty intuitive to use; you simply glide the roller brush over the debris you’re looking to remove. You may need to pass the vacuum over an area a few times to fully suction up all the dust and particles. Cordless vacuums make this even easier because you don’t need to find a wall outlet to plug the machine into. Instead, make sure to have your vacuum charged before use. Most of the devices have a battery life of under one hour, so you’ll need to charge them in between cleaning. Some more high-tech models feature additional energy modes, so choose the right one for your needs to get the most from your battery life.</p><p>If your vacuum comes with accessories, remember to switch to the right attachment for different surfaces. For instance, a crevice tool is great for narrow spaces, while a dust brush may be softer on precious materials. While the dustbin capacity will vary between different vacuums, be sure to empty the bin regularly so that you can continue to trap dust effectively. You may also want to assess the roll bar to see if any hair or other debris has gotten tangled, which might hinder the suction power.</p><h2 id=how-cordless-models-can-simplify-cleaning-tasks>How cordless models can simplify cleaning tasks</h2><p>Cordless models are lightweight and easy to maneuver, in part because they don’t have a long cord that needs to stay attached to the wall. Instead, you easily move from room to room without fear of tripping over the cord or accidentally pulling it from the outlet. Most cordless models can also be converted to a handheld vacuum, which makes it easier to clean furniture and soft furnishings. Because the majority of cordless vacuums are bagless, you won’t need to worry about keeping a supply of dustbags in stock; you can simply empty the dustbin into a regular trash can. Finally, many cordless models feature advanced technology and LED screens, which allow you to optimize cleaning through the auto-detection of surfaces and selection of various power modes. To really simplify cleaning, however, consider</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How long is the battery life on cordless vacuums?</h3><p>Battery life will vary across different cordless vacuums, as each brand uses their own battery. Similarly, the charge time of those batteries also varies. In general, most reputable brands will support battery life in the 40 to 60 minute range. For handheld cordless vacuums, you can expect a much shorter battery life of around 10 to 15 minutes, however these are designed for smaller jobs so this shouldn’t be a problem.</p><h3>What is the difference between an upright vacuum and a cordless stick vacuum?</h3><p>An upright vacuum is the traditional style of vacuum cleaner, featuring a corded design that plugs into a wall outlet and a removable dust bag that needs to be replaced after use. They tend to be larger but more powerful, making them ideal for heavy duty jobs and busier households. However, they can be more difficult to navigate around the house due to their size and weight.</p><p>A cordless stick vacuum is much slimmer in design and runs on battery power, so it doesn’t need to be plugged into a power socket during use. Instead, it can be easily carried around the house as needed, with useful handheld detachments that can treat furniture, appliances or soft furnishings. In exchange for maneuverability, you’ll get a smaller dustbin and slightly less suction power, although high-end models can still be effective. best-cordless-vacuum-cleaners-time-20</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lk6S%2FpbjErKpmrpGYwra5jJyjnpmemr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-cordless-vacuum-cleaners.html&text=Best%20Cordless%20Vacuum%20Cleaners%20of%202024&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-cordless-vacuum-cleaners.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-cordless-vacuum-cleaners.html&title=Best%20Cordless%20Vacuum%20Cleaners%20of%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-cordless-vacuum-cleaners.html&title=Best%20Cordless%20Vacuum%20Cleaners%20of%202024" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-cordless-vacuum-cleaners.html&title=Best%20Cordless%20Vacuum%20Cleaners%20of%202024" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-cordless-vacuum-cleaners.html&description=Best%20Cordless%20Vacuum%20Cleaners%20of%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gloria-steinem-womens-liberation-progress.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gloria Steinem Reflects on Women's Liberation 50 Years Later">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1417320-babban-limanin-jamiar-unimaid-zai-aurar-yayansa-10-rana-guda-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Babban Limamim jami'ar UNIMAID zai aurar 'yayansa 10 rana guda">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
